GXC CMS is an open source CMS written on Yii Framework. It has been developed since July 2011 by Tuan Nguyen and http://www.tringuyen.me from GxcSolutions (Non-profit organization). This CMS can help you to make not only a newspaper specifc website ( Workflow Transfer, History tracking,...) but also a basic social network.

One of the "best" features of the CMS is the Page - Layout and Blocks Module. You can create multiple pages with different layouts and you can add blocks on each page. Blocks are easy to develop for Backend and Frontend.

The CMS is now version 1.0. It has all the features for a basic CMS. If you love PHP and Yii, feel free to join us to make this CMS better.

I will list down all current features of the CMS.
